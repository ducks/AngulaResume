<h2>Howdy, y'all</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m Jake and I&rsquo;m a programmer. I was born and raised in the 
  hills of West Virginia. I currently reside in Brooklyn, NYC but am in the
  process of moving to Portland, OR.</p>

<p>My focus is the web but I love all kinds of programming. 
  I&rsquo;m also a strong believer in polyglot
  programming and try not to limit myself to any language.</p> 
  
<p>I&rsquo;ve been programming professionally for 8 years; 
  5 of those with Infinity Interactive. I started on the frontend by 
  learning HTML/CSS/JS and using PHP, primarily with the Drupal CMS.
  I even made some contributions to the Drupal core code.</p>

<p>With it&rsquo;s growing progress and popularity, I next learned Node.js.
  Combine that with The Great MVC Rush of the mid 2010s and the result
  is 2-3 years of Angular experience.</p>

<p>Along the way, I've dabbled in perl, python, and ruby. Perl being the
  strongest of the those. I've also recently started learning Rust and 
  systems programming.</p>

<p>Aside from actual programming, I love unix/linux and the command line. I
  use vim for text editing, irssi for irc, and cmus to play music. I started
  out on the LAMP stack and although I rarely use the AMP these days, the L
  has stuck around.</p>
