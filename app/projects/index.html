<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Ghidorah</h3>
<p>I am currently writing a mobile first, but fully responsive Jira client.
  Jira is a ticketing system with a less than perfect mobile experience. The
  frontend of the app is written in Angular. It uses the sass css preprocessor
  and the bourbon library of mixins. It use browserify to bundle up the
  node modules for the web, and use npm as the build tool. It follows the 
  Angular best practices for code organization.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also written a backend api and authenication proxy. Instead of
  hitting the Jira instance directly with Angular, I utilize this server to
  help keep things secure with OAuth2 and to make the requests as quick as 
  possible. Koa is server written in node that uses a new javascript feature
  called generators. These are basically functions you can pause and replay.

<h3>Taxchat</h3>
<p>Taxchat is the Uber of filing taxes. You sign up, answer some questions and
then are paired with a tax preparer. There was a mobile app, an api, and a
web app.</p>

<p>I was tasked with writing the web app. This is the interface for 
  the preparer. The preparer could see a list of clients, chat with them and see
  their info and documents.</p>

<p>This was also written in Angular. It has a very similiar workflow as
  Ghidorah. It uses sass and bourbon and is built with browserify and npm.</p>

<p>It also included a document upload section.</p>
